      set to “ON-ORDER”, that means it is a pre-paid order, i.e. the payment is
      collected at the time of order confirmation. If this parameter is set to
      “ON-FULFILLMENT”, that means it is a pay at the end of the trip, i.e. the

    Description: >-
      The time period from completion of the Settlement Basis within which the

      an example, if the Settlement Basis is set as “trip complete” and the
      Settlement Window is set to 7 days, and the Seller App collects the
      payment, it means the Seller App will remit funds to the Buyer App on or
      before the completion of the 7th day after successful completion of the
      trip,

      ISO8601 duration notation is used to specify the value of the parameter.
      As an illustration, a Settlement Window of 5 days after delivery can be
      specified as “P5D” (i.e. period 5 days) or “PT120H” (i.e. period 120
      hours).

      share of the Buyer Price to the Seller App’s account via RTGS.

  - Term: Delay Interest
    Api: search / on_search / init / on_init
    Attribute: DELAY_INTEREST

      This is the annual rate of interest that the Payment Collector will be
      charged if they delay a payment to the counterparty Network Participant,
      calculated pro rata for each calendar day of delay. As an example, if the
      value is set as “7.3”, and the amount of payment due is INR 1000, that
      will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
      Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
      rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days,
      the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
      1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

      Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the
      Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC
      Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
      Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
      Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network
      Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.

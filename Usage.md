# Repository Structure

**Note:** All folders mentioned here are relative to the root folder `protocol-specs`

The full specification can be found at `api/build/build.yaml`

This is an autogenerated file created by compiling multiple sets of components namely,

1. Enum: found at `api/components/enum/`
   * These are all the enums used in specification while creating the artifact
2. Tags: found at `api/components/tags/`
   * These are all the tags/taggroups used in specification while creating the artifact
3. Examples: found at `api/components/examples/`
   * These are the examples created Illustrative use of the specification and embeeded in the yaml
   * Structure `api/components/examples/{module/feature/use case}/{API_Folder}/example_{#}.yaml`
4. Unresolved YAML: found at `api/components/beck_yaml.yaml`

# Setup steps

## Pre-requisite

### Install swagger CLI

- Install the swagger command line tool using ``npm`` (Note: you may need to use root privileges if installing it globally)

```
sudo npm install -g swagger-cli
```

## Generate the resolved OpenAPI illustration viewer file on-demand

- Run the following command[mac]

```
cd ./api/components
./build_util {example_set}
```

- If the command runs successfully, you should see an output like this,

```
Created ../build/build.yaml from ./temp.yaml
Temporary file deleted
```
